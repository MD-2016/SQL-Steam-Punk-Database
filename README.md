# SQL-Steam-Punk-Database
A SQL Server database that is meant to be like Steam (the gaming program). The goal was to build a large scale database with multiple tables and design the database on paper. This is the resulting database. This includes tables for the following...

1. Game User

1. Purchase Order
1. Vendor
1. Games
1. DLC
1. Promotion
1. Achievements
1. Community

These are the tables used in this database. They handle the fictional company data. Steam's database could have a similar design and layout of tables.
